# Note-Pad

# Project

The project was to create an app where a user can take notes and delete them at the user convienience. 

# Method

The app uses GET, POST and DELETE methods to get API ROUTES to .html files.

# Result

In the end, I was able to create the app as intended. As always, I would like to says Thanks to my Instructional Staff - Jonathan Watson, the best of the TA's and my tutor who never gives up on me.
